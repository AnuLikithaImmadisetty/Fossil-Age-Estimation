## Dataset and Description 
This dataset consists of 24 columns and records the details of fossil specimens, with 9302 observations, representing a variety of geological and biological characteristics. The data captures vital attributes such as geographic locations, taxonomic classifications, dating techniques, and various stratigraphic and taphonomic details, all contributing to estimating fossil ages accurately.

The [Dataset](https://github.com/AnuLikithaImmadisetty/Fossil-Age-Estimation/blob/main/Datasets/fossil_data.csv) is available here! Below are the Descriptions of the columns available in the dataset:

- **ID:** A unique identifier assigned to each fossil specimen.
- **Latitude:** Latitude coordinates indicating the north-south position where the fossil was discovered.
- **Longitude:** Longitude coordinates indicating the east-west position of the fossil discovery.
- **Genus:** The genus classification of the fossilized organism.
- **Species:** The species classification of the fossilized organism.
- **Family:** The family to which the fossilized organism belongs.
- **Class:** The class of the fossilized organism in the biological taxonomy.
- **Infra-Class:** A subclassification within the broader class of the organism.
- **Order:** The order in the taxonomic hierarchy of the fossilized organism.
- **Status:** The current research status of the fossil specimen (e.g., whether it has been confirmed, pending, etc.).
- **Megafauna:** A binary indicator (Yes/No) showing whether the fossil belongs to a megafauna species.
- **Age ID:** A unique identifier for the fossil's estimated age.
- **Dated Remain:** The specific fossil remain that was dated (e.g., bone, tooth, etc.).
- **Dated Material:** The type of material that was used to determine the fossil’s age.
- **Age:** The estimated age of the fossil, usually in years.
- **Age Type:** The classification of the age (e.g., estimated, exact, etc.).
- **Dating Technique:** The technique used to date the fossil (e.g., radiocarbon dating, stratigraphy).
- **Overall Region:**  The broad geographic region where the fossil was discovered.
- **Administrative Division:** The administrative region or division (e.g., country, state) where the fossil was found.
- **Specific Region:** A more precise geographical description of where the fossil was located.
- **Cave/Site/Deposit:** The cave, site, or deposit in which the fossil was discovered.
- **Chamber/Provenance:** Specific chamber or location within the site from where the fossil was excavated.
- **Stratigraphy/Taphonomy:** Details about the fossil’s stratigraphy or taphonomic history.
- **Species abundances:** The number of fossils or abundance of the species in the excavation site.
- **Year:** The year the fossil was excavated or analyzed.
  
## Features 
The Fossil Age Estimation project incorporates the following components:
1. **🧪 Data Analysis**: Analyze fossil datasets to extract meaningful features for accurate age prediction.
2. **🧠 Machine Learning Models**: Implement, train, and optimize various around 30 machine learning models to estimate the age of fossils.
3. **📈 Evaluation Metrics**: Evaluate model performance using metrics like RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error), MAE (Mean Absolute Error), R² and Explained Variance.

## Tools and Technologies
This project employs a diverse array of machine learning models to predict fossil ages. 

### Machine Learning Models:

🗳 **LinearRegression:** A fundamental regression technique that models the relationship between input features and a continuous target variable using a linear equation.  
🌳 **Random Forest Regression:** An ensemble method that constructs multiple decision trees and averages their predictions to enhance accuracy and control overfitting.  
🧠 **SVR (Support Vector Regression):** A regression technique that uses support vector machines to fit the best line within a specified margin, capable of handling non-linear relationships.   
🔍 **SVR with GridSearchCV:** A support vector regression model optimized using grid search to find the best hyperparameters for improved predictive performance.
